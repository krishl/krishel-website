With a natural inclination for technology throughout my life, I began coding website layouts and designing graphics on Photoshop at the age of 9, fulfilling 1,500 design requests online for free. During this time, I also helped my mother build and maintain an eCommerce website for her business.

I spent my high school years in Brooklyn Technical High School as a Chemical Engineering major, while also taking classes outside my major such as “Design & Drafting for Production,” “Introduction to Electricity,” and “Architectural Drawing.” Outside of school I developed an interest in Korean entertainment, strong enough that I wanted to help the English-speaking community by aiding in the English subtitling process. I taught myself Korean and volunteered in several subtitling teams, taking charge of the segmenting and video encoding processes. I also created 300+ GIFs from these shows using Photoshop and ran contests for the online community.

I majored in Economics at Hunter College and was elected as Webmaster for the pre-dental club by my sophomore year. Toward the end of college I got the opportunity to take elective courses such as “Introduction to Computer Science,” “Computers and Money,” and “Introduction to Python,” all of which amplified my interest in computer technology.

After graduating, I explored careers that combined technology with analytical thinking and creativity – three skills that I have honed and enjoyed throughout my life. After evaluating the culmination of my past experiences, I studied web development, networking, and data science to further my career as a technology professional.
